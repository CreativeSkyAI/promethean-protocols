> **Access restricted. Authorized personnel only.**

A fully interactive cyberpunk-themed landing page featuring a realistic terminal interface with Matrix-style falling code rain, functional commands, and dramatic system failure simulations. Built entirely with v0's intuitive interface - no complex configuration or prompt engineering required.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Use v0 Community Template (Recommended)
**[üìã Clone from v0 Community](https://v0.app/community/cyberpunk-terminal-landing-page-8JxLcDfLPsc?b=b_94iBUcP8HMa)**

The fastest way to get started is using the v0 community template with live demo. Simply click the link above to:
- View the live interactive demo
- Clone the template to your v0 workspace
- Deploy instantly to Vercel
- Customize with natural language prompts

### Option 2: Traditional Git Clone
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/promprot/promprot-terminal
cd promprot.com
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

## üìã Overview

A fully interactive cyberpunk-themed landing page featuring a realistic terminal interface with Matrix-style falling code rain, functional commands, and dramatic system failure simulations. The terminal responds to commands and includes a spectacular "flipbits" command that triggers ASCII art display, promethean protocol errors, and system failure simulation.

### Key Concept

The site presents itself as a restricted access terminal system, complete with authentic terminal command prompt (`root@promprot:~$`), real-time UTC clock display, and interactive command system with dramatic easter eggs.

## ‚ú® Features

- üñ•Ô∏è Fully functional terminal interface with command processing
- üåßÔ∏è Animated Matrix-style code rain background
- ‚è∞ Real-time clock display with timezone in terminal header
- üé≠ Multiple interactive commands with authentic responses
- üí• Dramatic system crash simulation with ASCII art and kernel panic details
- üì± Fully responsive design for all devices
- üé® Authentic cyberpunk aesthetic with green-on-black styling
- üîó SEO optimized with Open Graph tags and social sharing

### Interactive Terminal Commands
- `help` - Display available commands
- `whoami` - Show user information with social links
- `time` - Display current date, time, and timezone
- `about` - Information about Promethean Protocols
- `clear` - Clear the terminal screen
- `scan` - Run intrusion detection sequence
- `trace` - Execute network trace to target host
- `access` - Attempt to access promethean protocols (requires authorization)
- `flipthebits` - Trigger dramatic system failure with ASCII art
<!-- Removed reference to /stopcode redirect -->

### Visual Effects
- **Code Rain Animation** - Matrix-style falling characters background
- **Terminal Aesthetics** - Authentic command-line interface styling
- **Responsive Design** - Optimized for all device sizes
- **Typography** - Custom font with monospace terminal text
- **ASCII Art** - Large PROMPROT logo displayed on system exit with proper formatting
- **System Failure Simulation** - Complete crash sequence with kernel panic and redirect

### Easter Eggs
- **System Failure Simulation** - Complete crash sequence with kernel panic
- **Command History** - Navigate previous commands with arrow keys
- **Access Denied** - Security-themed command responses
- **Glitch Effects** - Subtle animations and visual distortions
- **Hidden Commands** - Discover secret functionality through exploration

### Continuous Deployment
- Automatically deploys from this repository via Vercel
- Changes sync from v0.app development environment
- Production builds optimized for performance

## üôè Acknowledgments
Built with incredible ease using v0 by Vercel. Special thanks to **Guillermo Rauch** (CEO) and the entire Vercel team for creating a tool that truly "just works" - no complex prompt engineering, configuration files, or lengthy setup required. v0's intuitive interface allowed for rapid prototyping and iteration, making it possible to build this complex interactive experience through simple conversational requests.

This template showcases how v0 transforms complex ideas into production-ready code through natural conversation, eliminating the traditional barriers between concept and implementation.
